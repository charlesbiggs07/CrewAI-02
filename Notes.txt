***
In many programming contexts, the `verbose` parameter is used to control the level of output detail provided by a
program, often for debugging or informational purposes. This parameter typically accepts an integer or boolean
value, where a higher integer value results in more detailed output.

- **0**: Minimal verbosity. Typically, this level will output nothing or only critical errors necessary
 for basic operation.
- **1**: Moderate verbosity. This level might include important operational messages that provide insight into
 the flow of execution without too much detail.
- **2**: Detailed verbosity. At this level, the program will likely output detailed debugging information,
 tracing computations, and operations step-by-step.
